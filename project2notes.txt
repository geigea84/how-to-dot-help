to do

update files to remote database when finished testing locally:
.env
public/php/searchDB.php
config/connection.js

Admin Page: admin.handlebars, volApiCalls.js, (route connection example: home-routes, volApiCalls)
- needs add new NFP (done), edit, and delete
- needs to pull volunteers by name and NFP joined
- make useful on page/make everything work
- admin privileges - create account, command line abilities to said account

=====================================================================================================

feature/users - 

res.render?
session id to access admin page? - may have to ask about this one

***1 user table, grant admin to select individuals in table
-how would we go about having a column for admin only that wouldn't be filled out/viewed by volunteers?
--idea: column is created but not displayed, manually enter permission into database (boolean), default in model is false, 
--permission is to access the admin page, route contains statement to call true value in respective column 

-router.get volunteer:id - run two router.gets?
